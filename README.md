# BountyForum React Project

## Project Description:
BountyForum is a lighthearted course forum designed to boost class engagement through a unique bounty points system. This innovative approach allows students to attach bounty points to their questions, incentivizing peers to provide helpful answers. By earning points for their contributions, students are encouraged to participate actively, fostering a dynamic and collaborative learning environment.

The integration of leaderboards, badges, and a point exchange system adds an extra layer of motivation, making the forum not only educational but also engaging and fun.

This project is for college students who want a fun way to engage more in class forums, our project is a forum system with a bounty points system that makes asking and answering questions way more interactive. It motivates students by letting them earn points for helpful answers and attaching points to their own questions to get faster responses. Unlike other forums like Piazza or Moodle, ours is all about making learning fun and rewarding, with leaderboards, badges, and an easy-to-use setup that boosts participation and collaboration.

## Project Components Description:
### Bounty Point System: 
Students can post questions and attach bounty points, incentivizing others to answer. Bounty points will be displayed next to each question, creating an interactive atmosphere where users are encouraged to provide helpful answers to earn points.

### Leaderboard and Badges: 
The leaderboard will encourage healthy competition by showing the most active users in the class. Badges earned for answering questions or consistently participating will provide additional motivation for students to engage.

### Question and Answer Interface: 
The forum will feature a clean, intuitive feed where students can ask questions, post answers, and track bounty claims in real-time.

### Backend Infrastructure: 
The back-end will handle user authentication, point transactions, and leaderboard updates. A lightweight database (SQLite for the MVP) will store user data, questions, answers, and bounty points. Data retrieval and real-time updates will be facilitated using efficient database queries and asynchronous API calls.
