# BountyForum React Project

## Project Description:
BountyForum is a lighthearted course forum designed to boost class engagement through a unique bounty points system. This innovative approach allows students to attach bounty points to their questions, incentivizing peers to provide helpful answers. By earning points for their contributions, students are encouraged to participate actively, fostering a dynamic and collaborative learning environment.

The integration of leaderboards, badges, and a point exchange system adds an extra layer of motivation, making the forum not only educational but also engaging and fun.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
